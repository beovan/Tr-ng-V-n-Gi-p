<p align="left">I'm a web development student with my sights set on building awesome websites! I'm not just focused on the flashy user interface (think ReactJS) you see when you visit a site, but also the powerful engine that makes it all work behind the scenes (think Laravel and ExpressJS) . I'm ready to put my skills to the test and ready to learn even more in a professional setting.

  <h3>Booking for patient</h3>  <ul>
   <li>Source Code: <a href="https://github.com/beovan/Backend-nodejs-Booking-care">Back End</a> -  <a href="https://github.com/beovan/Frontend-ReactJS-Booking-care">Front End</a></li>  
   <li>Type: Personal Project</li>  
   <li>Description: This project is a patient booking system built with a modern tech stack to streamline appointment scheduling.

**Technologies:** ReactJS + Redux (Frontend), HTML/CSS-SCSS/Bootstrap4 (Reactstrap) (Frontend UI), Node.js (Express) (Backend), MySQL (Sequelize) (Database)

**Key Features:**

* **User-friendly interface:** Patients can easily search for available appointments based on date, time, and doctor preferences using a responsive and visually appealing UI built with ReactJS, HTML/CSS preprocessed with SCSS for maintainability, and Bootstrap4 for rapid development.
* **Seamless scheduling:** Patients can book appointments directly within the application, with real-time availability displayed and clear confirmation messages sent after booking.
* **Doctor management:** Doctors can access and manage their appointment schedules through a dedicated dashboard or interface within the system. (Optional, depending on project scope)
* **Secure data storage:** Patient information and appointment details are securely stored in a MySQL database powered by Sequelize, an object-relational mapper (ORM) that simplifies data interaction between the Node.js backend and the database.

**Additional Considerations (Optional):**

* Integration with patient portals or healthcare information systems (optional).
* Reminder notifications for upcoming appointments (via email or SMS).
* Cancellation and rescheduling functionalities for appointments.

This project demonstrates proficiency in building a full-stack application with ReactJS, Redux for state management, Node.js, and Express for robust backend development. The use of MySQL and Sequelize ensures efficient data management and retrieval.
